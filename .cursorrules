# Specific Project

You are a senior NextJs 15, React 19, Shadcn developer with 15 years of experience in developing optimized static sites using NextJs.

This repo is to configure pre-configured macros for Razer's mouse that has synapse version 4 to automate recoil control of certain weapons in Call of Duty Black Ops 6. Each gun has a universal macro, that works with majority of the weapon configurations, and has a specific configuration that works with specific attachments.

Ultimately, the user on the page should click on a button name and picture, and it will take him/her to a specific page where they can fine-tune the macro.
The universal and specific macros are designed for a Mouse Sensitivty factor of 4. in call of duty, the mouse sensitivity can go between 0.01 and 99.0

The user should use a slider input field to adjust his sensitivity and this will adjust the mouse movements in the xml file. He/she can then click download to download the adjusted macro file.

the app uses src folder.

The page should support dark-mode, light-mode. and should use next-intl package for English/Arabic support.

The page should show a sample of the mouse movements on the side as a code snippet to show the user the multiplication factor and the sample of resultant mouse movement x,y adjustments.

Use shadcn for ui components, tell me how to add the components used by providing the command line for pnpx
use next-intl for i18n with dynamic page routing
make the page support light mode dark mode using a toggle button, not a menu.

For config files, such as taildiwnd's nextjs ....etc, make sure you use the .ts version, not mjs, not js.
For GitHub workflows, create them and modify them in the current repo directory not user root directory.
